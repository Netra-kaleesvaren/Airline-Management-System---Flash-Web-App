✈️ Design and Development of Airline Management System
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to simulate the core functionalities of an airline management system. Built using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and SQLite, it offers a simple yet efficient way to manage various aspects of airline operations such as flight management, passenger details, and ticket bookings.

🔍 Key Features:
Flight Scheduling: Add, update, and manage flight information such as flight number, origin, destination, date, and time.

Passenger Management: Maintain a database of passenger records with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Booking System: Users can book tickets and view booking history.

Admin Interface: Provides admin-level functionalities to manage data securely and efficiently.

Data Storage: All data is stored using SQLite, a lightweight relational database embedded in the application.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3

Database: SQLite

This system is ideal for learning purposes and demonstrates how web technologies can be used to build real-time CRUD applications with a focus on clean UI and maintainable code structure.
